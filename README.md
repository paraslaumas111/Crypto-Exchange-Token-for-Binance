#About -

Crypto Exchange Token for Binance (Tech Stack: Express.js, React, Node.js, Motoko)
 
 • Developed a Decentralized Application (DApp) for users to send and receive a newly created cryptocurrency token
 “DANG” seamlessly on the Internet Computer Blockchain (ICB).
 
 • Integrated “Internet Identity”, a 3rd party authentication partner, to provide an anonymous and secure blockchain
 authentication framework supported by the ICB.
 
 • Utilized Motoko and JavaScript to develop the backend, employing HashMaps to efficiently store and manage users’
 crypto token balances.
 
 • Implemented a feature allowing users to claim some free tokens initially, encouraging adoption and increasing user
 engagement with the DApp.
 
 • Leveraged the decentralized storage capabilities of the blockchain for data persistence, eliminating the need for
 traditional DBMS software.
